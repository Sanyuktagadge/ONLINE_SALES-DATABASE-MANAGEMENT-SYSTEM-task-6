 Error Handling
   
Invalid Data Types – Ensure proper casting (e.g., CAST, CONVERT) when comparing or aggregating numeric fields.

Missing or Null Values – Use IS NULL or COALESCE() to handle potential null entries in key columns.

Table or Column Not Found – Verify table and column names match your database schema before executing the script.

Performance Considerations
Use Indexes – Apply indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, or GROUP BY clauses to speed up queries.

Avoid SELECT – Only fetch needed columns to reduce I/O overhead.

Optimize Joins – Ensure joins are performed on indexed and properly constrained keys to prevent full table scans.
